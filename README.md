# Run the Exercism Clojure track with Full Interactive Programming in the browser

This is a [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) template configured for running the [Exercism Clojure Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure) in a zero-install fashion in your browser, leveraging [Calva](https://calva.io) and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

## Rationale

Why would you want to use another web browser editor than the Exercism built in one? Because this one supports Interactive Programming (aka REPL Driven Development). It is one of Clojure's main super powers and if you are going to spend time learning Clojure, you probably also should learn the habits and the workflow that makes Clojure programmers so happy and effective.

## How to use

1. Copy this project by click the ‚ÄùUse this Template‚Äù button.
   * Reading this from your newly created copy? Awesome. 
1. Open this link: https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/
   * This will open the repository in a Gitpod workspace in the browser.
   * _NB: If you don't have a Gitpod account, use the option to **Sign-up with GitHub**._

<details><summary>Using Safari?</summary>

Then the link probably won't work. Instead prepend the repository URL with `https://gitpod.io/#` and load that page.

</details>

It might take a little while, but it is well worth the wait, because in your browser you'll then have:

* A Linux virtual machine with full root access and these things installed:
    * Java
    * The Clojure tools
    * VS Code (or Gitpod Code, actually)
       * With [Calva](https://calva.io) (a Clojure extension)
    * The `exercism` command line tool
* A workspace
    * Prepared for hosting your Exercism exercises
    * Gitpod Code started and a file `INSTRUCTIONS.md` opened, which will guide you in how to download and submit [Exercism](https://exercism.orh) exercises.
