# Run the Exercism Clojure track with Full Interactive Programming in the browser

This is a [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) template configured for running the [Exercism Clojure Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure) in a zero-install fashion in your browser, leveraging [Calva](https://calva.io) and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

## How to use

1. Copy this project by click the ”Use this Template” button.
   * Reading this from your newly created copy? Awesome. 
1. Open this link: https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/
   * This will open the repository in a Gitpod workspace in the browser.
   * _NB: If you don't have a Gitpod account, use the option to **Sign-up with GitHub**._

<details><summary>Using Safari?</summary>

Then the link probably won't work. Instead prepend the repository URL with `https://gitpod.io/#` and load that page.

</details>

It might take a little while, but it is well worth the wait, because in your browser you'll then have:

* A Linux virtual machine with full root access and these things installed:
    * Java
    * The Clojure tools
    * VS Code (or Gitpod Code, actually)
       * With [Calva](https://calva.io) (a Clojure extension)
    * The `exercism` command line tool
* A workspace
    * Prepared for hosting your Exercism exercises
    * Gitpod Code started and a file `INSTRUCTIONS.md` opened, which will guide you in how to download and submit [Exercism](https://exercism.orh) exercises.
